# Brand Design App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

Import list of created brand assets, then let the user combine those assets in a way that is cohesive with their brand.

### App.js

Contains overall app structure.
Also handles keyboard shortcut detection.

### Menu.js

Generates a list of available parts from `parts.js`

### Options.js

When a part is the active selection, the available options for that part are displayed here. The available options are listed in `parts.js`.

### Toolbar.js

Contains utility functions. Currently just exporting and toggling the guides.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
